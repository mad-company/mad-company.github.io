Here is a 10 iOS softwares list I use daily, weekly or monthly. Most of them are well known but maybe you’ll find a few one that you’ve never used ;)

I’ve chosen to group them in 3 categories : **Debug** (🛠), **Productivity** (📈) et **Keynote** (🎤).

# 🛠 Debug

## 1. [Sherlock](https://sherlock.inspiredcode.io) (🕵️‍♂️)

This is one of the tools that I use mostly during development process… Mainly because of two major features  :
- **Simulation** of different devices screen sizes while executing code only once
- **Inspection** of the view and constraint in real time

OK, it’s not cheap ($49) but it makes me gain lots of time on new feature I’m developing especially if it’s has to be *pixel perfect* on iPhone SE, Pro Max, 11, XR, etc…
It definitely worth it !

## 2. [Reveal](https://revealapp.com) (👁)

In the same spirit as Sherlock, here is THE software to inspect your app under all details during development process… A little bit more expensive ($59) but more options and features provided, it allows you to :

- **Browse**  views hierarchies more efficiently than Xcode builtin tool
- **Inspect** your *Gesture Recognizers*
- **Analyse** constraints
- **Edit** views in real time
- Also working with **App Extensions**

## 3. [Kaleidoscope](https://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com) (👮‍♀️)

This is the file comparaison specialist. This soft was initialement developed by Blackpixel, and allows you to compare :

- text files
- directories
- images

For my part, it mainly helps me in **Git merge conflicts** (especially in this #@&ç§(&@ `project.pbxproj` file). Luckily, Kaleidoscope ($70) perfectly fit in with my Git. client [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com).

## 4. [Charles proxy](https://www.charlesproxy.com/documentation/ios/) (🔎)

Charles is one of the best friend of my collegues from Q&A team. This soft helps them to validate datas entering the app from different webservices. Briefly, this is :

- a HTTP proxy
- a reverse proxy to sniff all http(s) traffic (request, headers HTTP, responses, etc...)

This app cost $50 on Mac and an iOS client is also available for $10.

Remarque: [une appli iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/charles-proxy/id1134218562?mt=8), moins cher (9$) permet de sniffer rapidement et extrêment facilement les flux. *"La recette"* et moi, on est fan !

## 5. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) (📬)

This app helps you to manage APIs along your develpement cycle :

- develop / debug
- test / mock / monitoring
- share collections
- documentation

Very powerfull, there are several prices from free for basic features to $18 / mois for complete features

# 📈 Productivity

## 6. [Pastebot](https://tapbots.com/pastebot/) (😎)


Here is the **copy/paste King** !

It could be for refactoring your code, writing an article, an email or even a simple Slack message, copy/paste is a must-have feature...
 
But if you knew what a small app like Pastebot can bring you, you would adopt it quickly I bet... I'm talking about copy multiple lines of text and/or code and then paste them where you want add filters, format them before pasting, etc... It's price ? $13 !

## 7. [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) (⚙️)

You're using Spotlight on macOS ? Let's say that Alfred could be its father... at least its mentor, the one that learn everything to him... But in more complete and more powerfull.

Personaly, I only use Alfred as it allows me to :
- **launch** my favorites apps
- **search** my local files or whatever on the Internet
- control my music
- calculator

But more important, it gives me the opportunity to **add worflows** that I use to **quickly translate texts**, open website directly where I want (for example the `PR` command open my *Github repo* to *Pull Request* segment), compress images, interact with Slack, Mail, switch between Wifi and Ethernet, shutdown my mac (yes I do this sometimes ;)), ... 
Basic version is free and extension (includng workflow cost £23).

# 🎤 Keynotes

## 8. [Deckset](https://www.deckset.com) (🎥)

If you don't know this software, this is a big classical one for a nowdays developer. A *must-have* that cost €29.
It will help you while realising keynote written in **Markdown**, with code syntaxic color, photos, videos, etc...
Deckset also offers lots of different themes that you can also personalize as you wish.

(Remark: initialy developed by Chris Eidhof)

## 9. [Snippetty](http://snippetty.io) (👨‍💻)

This app is for **live coding** adepts. To be brief, you add code pieces (aka *snippets*) in a markdown file and then, step by step during your live session/demo you can very quickly and very easily copy/paste your lines of code.

## 10. [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com) (📝)

This is my Markdown editor to write articles, keynote (before finishing them on Deckset) and other markdown documents. Easy to use, convenient, opensource and aesthetic, this editor is totally free.

# To conclude 

So here was a 10 apps list that facilitate my daily work as an iOS developer. These tools took lots of time to lots of developers as you and me to be developed. So they have a price, most of them are not free. Ideally,  make their price supported by the one you work for. They will make you gain a precious time, you’ll be more efficient at work for the company that hired you…
