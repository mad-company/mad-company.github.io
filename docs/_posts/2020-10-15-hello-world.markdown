This is my first post on this blog and I hope there will have lots of them in the #future ! 

I’m a nearly forty years old iOS independent developer based in Paris, France 🥐🍷🥖🇫🇷

After a decade being working for different companies, this year I've decided to make a move and become an independent iOS developer, for the best and for the worst 😬

It’s an old dream and I want to live it before it’s too late (for family reasons for example) to take this kind of riss... #noregret

I’m giving myself a year and then I'll make a point.

First of all, I need a company to get an identity and to manage the money.

So here comes the _Mobile App Developers Company_ also known as the **MAD Company**.

I hope you will enjoy apps and readings...

See you around 👋
