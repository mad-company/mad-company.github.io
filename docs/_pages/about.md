## Foundation

Founded in 2020 by Jérémie Godon, the MAD Company is a Mobile Applications Developers Company based in Paris, France.

## Ambitions

The main goal of MAD Company is to ship applications (mainly iOS apps at the moment) built with a **smart, tested and modern code**.

We always use the **latest frameworks** and **interface elements** of our applications are **natives** (no custom, no hybrides, no UX freestyle as much as possible). 

Moreover, our apps respect **user privacy** by design.

## Currently

Since October 2020, the MAD Company started the development of a new iOS product **in association with hawk•ci**  that will help mobile developers from all around the world to increase their efficiency while using a well-known Continious Integration service...
